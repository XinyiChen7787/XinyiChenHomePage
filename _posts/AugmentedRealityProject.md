# Project description
Recently, Augmented Reality(AR) techniques have been exposed and utilized by many software developers in many facets. The
use of AR has been used in a variety of fields, from expensive industrial level which usually requires high level head mounted
display to cheap and simple level such as entertainment where a normal smartphone can be used as the platform. Our project, the
OSU AR CAMPUS TOUR(OACT) focused mainly on the use of AR in education, navigation and also entertainment fields. In general,
the primary goal of OACT is to help the new students of OSU to have a safe(consider the current pandemic), easy(customizable)
and highly motivated(scavenger-hunt gamification features) way to explore and get familiar with the campus and learn the
historical background of the major landscapes of OSU.

**Related Works**

Various studies explore AR's role in education, with Lee et al. and Ardiny et al. focusing on its use for knowledge acquisition, outlining its advantages and disadvantages. Rossano et al. specifically investigate AR's support in Geometry learning. In the realm of history education, Compeau et al. introduce a VR and AR history game, while Tsai et al. showcase an AR mobile app augmenting important buildings with gamification. Inspired by these works, our group enhances our OACT applications with scavenger-hunt gamification features, merging educational content with engaging gameplay for an enriched learning experience.

# Research studies
For the search study, our research group did some research on AR technology and its applications. These related
papers provided some inspiration for our project. H. Papagiannisâ€™ research provides a way to display information
in AR. the use of 2d images might be able to give a good overview as it shown in the paper. In general this idea of
AR joiners uses movie clips to show a series of images in an AR environment to enhance the user experience. In our
project, we tried some similar ways to provide some guidance for users.
